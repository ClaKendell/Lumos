# Lumos
This is the source code repository: Lumos: An Open-Source Device for Wearable Spectroscopy Research

### What's Included?
1. Hardware & Schematics
2. Arduino Code to Run the Lumos Device
3. Form Factor Designs
4. Python Source Code for the Wavelength Detection Algorithm
5. Example Python Code for Detecting the Wavelength of Various Mediums

### 1. Hardware & Schematics
Hardware and Schematics contains a list of components needed to put together a Lumos device, the schematics for our custom PCB, and instructions for purchasing the PCB.
@Anush - Add instructions for how to put together the board. Eventually, would be useful to have a place to purchase a full put together device minus the form factors.

### 2. Form Factor Designs
