# Lumos
This is the source code repository: Lumos: An Open-Source Device for Wearable Spectroscopy Research
@Amanda update for 
### What's Included?
1. Hardware & Schematics
2. Form Factor Designs
3. Arduino Code
4. Python Source Code for the Spectral Response of Medium
5. Example Python Code for Detecting the Wavelength of Various Mediums

### 1. Hardware & Schematics
Hardware and Schematics contains a list of components needed to put together a Lumos device, the schematics for our custom PCB, and instructions for purchasing the PCB.
@Anush - Add instructions for how to put together the board. Eventually, would be useful to have a place to purchase a full put together device minus the form factors.

### 2. Form Factor Designs
Form factor designs contain the @Anush - need you input here. 3D printer files and the CAD renderings @Anush used in the paper. @Anush add any instructions here about how to print the form factors, for example, what kind of plastic? 

### 3. Arduino Code
Here we include the wiring/circuit diagram for our device and the code used to control it. 
@Clarie add component diagram, Arduino code, any instructions that would be helpful. Once added, remove the test file from this folder
Our code is based off of: https://github.com/aawatson22/Raproto-Arduino

### 4. Algorithm that determines the spectral response of a medium. @Tarek - as you are working through, can you create a 
working example for the open source github? Not sure of the best way to do this. In the next round of data collection, 
the LED will be marked for each timestamp.
